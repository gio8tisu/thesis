This project has been carried in the Image Processing Group, ETSETB, UPC. Deep Learning is
highly computationally demanding, consequently a GPU was needed: The GPU GeForce GTX
Titan Black has an approximate cost of 920\euro{}, however UPC provided it to us without any cost.

The only cost that can be accounted for this project is the salary of the members involved
in it. Considering the amount of time that each member has put into this project and the
standard salary for junior engineers and senior engineers, the costs can
be summarized as follows:
